This is the bootstrap compiler for the stammer programming language created by Brendan Higgins.
Stammer is designed to be medium to low level programming language intended for generic
application development.  Stammer is a object-oriented, garbage collected, inferred type programming
language which compiles to assembly.  This compiler is written in the Go programming language and
is being created as a means to boot-strap the language. 

I started writing this compiler for educational purposes; thus, this compiler is completely written
from scratch.
